    <h1>Welcome to Our HealthCare System</h1>
    <p>Health is wealth. In the life of a human being health occupies an important place. Preservation of health should be the primary duty of mankind. Health is man’s normal condition, his birth right. It is the result of living in accordance with the natural laws, pertaining to the body, mind and environment. These laws relate to fresh air, sunlight, balanced diet, regular exercise, rest, relaxation and sleep, cleanliness internal and external, right attitudes of mind, good habits and good patterns of living. Our ignorance about health continues to be profound There are no yardsticks for measuring health. Health is often taken for granted and its value is not properly realized until it is lost. However, during the past few decades, there has been a reawakening that health is not merely a precious possession, but also a ‘resource’. So it is desirable to main­tain and promote health.</p>
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>Mental and physical health are probably the two most frequently discussed types of health.
Spiritual, emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health. Medical experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved mental and physical well-being.
      People with better financial health, for example, may worry less about finances and have the means to buy fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a sense of calm and purpose that fuels good mental health.</p>
    <h2>Physical health</h2>
    <p>A person who has good physical health is likely to have bodily functions and processes working at their peak.</p>
    <p>This is not only due not only to an absence of disease. Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest all contribute to good health. People receive medical treatment to maintain the balance, when necessary.</p>
      <p>Physical well-being involves pursuing a healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease. Maintaining physical fitness, for example, can protect and develop the endurance of a person’s breathing and heart function, muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition.</p>
  <p>Looking after physical health and well-being also involves reducing the risk of an injury or health issue, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1.minimizing hazards in the workplace</li>
    <li>2.using contraception when having sex</li>
    <li>3.practicing effective hygiene    </li>
    <li>4.avoiding the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs    </li>
    <li>5.taking the recommended vaccines for a specific condition or country when traveling    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Good physical health can work in tandem with mental health to improve a person’s overall quality of life.  </p>
  <h2>Mental health</h2>
  <p>According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, mental health refers to a person’s emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Mental health is as important as physical health as part of a full, active lifestyle. </p>
  <p>It is harder to define mental health than physical health because many psychological diagnoses depend on an individual’s perception of their experience.</p>
  <p>With improvements in testing, however, doctors are now able to identify some physical signs of some types of mental illness in CT scans and genetic tests.</p>
  <p>Good mental health is not only categorized by the absence of depression, anxiety, or another disorder. It also depends on a person’s ability to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.enjoy life</li>
  <li>2.bounce back after difficult experiences and adapt to adversity</li>
<li>3.balance different elements of life, such as family and finances</li>
<li>4.feel safe and secure</li>
<li>5.achieve their full potential</li>
</ul>  
<p>Physical and mental health have strong connections. For example, if a chronic illness affects a person’s ability to complete their regular tasks, it may lead to depression and stress. These feelings could be due to financial problems or mobility issues.</p>
<p>A mental illness, such as depression or anorexia, can affect body weight and overall function.</p>
<p>It is important to approach “health” as a whole, rather than as a series of separate factors. All types of health are linked, and people should aim for overall well-being and balance as the keys to good health.</p>
